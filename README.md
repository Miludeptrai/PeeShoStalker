21-10 : 
+ Practice cursing people with England accent
+ ...
+ Click() is detected 
+ Reload 25 times in a row at a same url -> IP limited
+ Almost get everything from the shop, this is the final "search_items?filter_sold_out=1" 
+ I use some app capture traffic, change url keep header before send, then I got detected immediately -> So I think, no way to Fuck their security. 
+ Whenever use excute_script or whatever, this web detects my chromnium, then redirect immediately,
+ Btw, I build this system reuseable, it also means I do not need to "LOG IN" 
+ Only shop crawling need authorize, they doesnt really care about stuffs pages (maybe there a lot of requests stuffs-pages then if they 'authorize' all of them, it may cause slow down traffic unnecessary)
+ I think, I will continue prj in  a few days
